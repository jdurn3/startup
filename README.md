## Key Features
- Secure login over HTTPS
- A group calendar listing trips of connected friends. 
- A general description of each trip. 
- Listed details such as date, location, gear needed, number of people, and climb difficulty. 
- Ability to submit and delete trips. 




## Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

**HTML** - Implements proper HTML structure for the application with two distinct pages – one dedicated to login and the other for submitting and viewing climbing trips. Includes hyperlinks for navigating between selected artifacts. Would display a calender view to make it easy for users to view. 

**CSS** - Employed to create a visually appealing and responsive interface, ensuring an immersive and user-friendly experience for climbers. 

**JavaScript** - Provides login, retirives details of trips, submits the trips, displays other scheduled trips, backend endpoint calls.

**Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
- login
- retrieving location, dates, number of people, difficulty, amd needed gear
- submitting trips
- retrieving trips 

**DB/Login** - Store users and trip data in database. Register and login users by storing credentials securely in database. Can't plan a trip unless authenticated.

**WebSocket** - When a trip is submitted, it is visible to other users.

**React** - The application has been adapted to utilize the React web framework.

## HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- HTML pages - Three HTML pages that represent the ability to login, sumbit/view trips, and chat with other climbers. 
- Links: The login page automatically links to the other two pages.
- Text: Texts describing the calendar and input options are present. 
- Images:  There are two images representing the structure of the messaging and calendar system. 
- DB/Login:  Input box and submit button for login. There is a submission form for the details of the trip. The calendar represents the data that will be shown from the databased containing the information received from the submission form. 
- WebSocket: The chat feature represents the real time ability to chat with other climbers.

## CSS Deliverable 
For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- Header, footer, and main content body: Made aeach element consistent across pages and appear appealing to the user. 
- Navigation elements: Designed a consistent nav bar that doesn't have the underlined word for the links. 
- Responsive to window resizing: The app looks great on different window sizes and devices. 
- Application elements - Used appealing colors that matched the outdoor aesthetic of rock climbing. 
- Application text content: Changed the fonts and size to emphasize key words.

## JavaScript Deliverable
For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- Login: handles the username and stores it in the localStorage API
- User display: displays the user across pages by retrieving it from the localStorage API. 
- Calender: handles the inpput for trip submissions. Stores and displays the data on a calender. 
- Chat: handles and displays the input responses for the chat aspect of the website.

## Service Deliverable 

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that receives trip sumbissions and displays them on a calendar. 

- Node.js/Express HTTP service
- Static middleware for frontend
- Calls to third party endpoints: Rotates through different pictures on the side of the chat for styling. 
- Backend service endpoints - Endpoints for submitting a trip. 
- Frontend calls service endpoints: I did this using the fetch function.

## Login Deliverable 
For this deliverable I created a database to store users login information.

- Created MongoDB Atlas database that stores login information.
- User registration - Creates a new account in the database.
- existing user - Stores trips under the same user.
- Restricts functionality - The submit a trip box will not be avaliable on the calendar page until you are logged in. Users not logged cannot submit a trip.
